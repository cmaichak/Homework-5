# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project was used to explore the homicide dataset from 50 cities collected by the Washington Post. Exploring the data was interesting and has a lot of potential to try new and exciting coding! Using the data, we look at results for Baltimore, MD only. The final plot created provides us with a visual to compare the trends from monthly and seasonal changes for multiple years.
